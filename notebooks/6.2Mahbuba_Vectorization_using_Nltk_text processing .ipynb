You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

HRC \",\n          \"The state of Israel has been able to cover up its racism to the world quite effectively over the years through the use of propaganda and a pretense to peace with the Palestinians. Some apologists for today s crazy right-wing government even argue that if only the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, would be replaced by a  dove,  then peace could be achieved with the Palestinians. However, the lack of peace and the fascism in Israel today is not rooted in its prime minister; rather, it is rooted in the ideology of Zionism that drives him and most Israelis. Zionists believe in an exclusively Jewish state and they always have. The only difference these days is that under the current right wing government, psychotic Israelis are the official main-stream of society and they burn babies and execute Palestinians without hesitation and they know that the government will protect them.This was all on display in Tel Aviv as thousands of Israelis came out in solidarity for the Israeli soldier who executed a Palestinian lying incapacitated on the ground a month ago. The soldier, Elor Azarya, who was filmed shooting the Palestinian last month in the occupied Palestinian town Al-Khalil (Hebron), is facing manslaughter charges. However, Israelis who injure or murder Palestinians rarely face consequences.Watch video of soldier executing Palestinian here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4]Thousands of Israelis rally in support of soldier who executed wounded Palestinian https://t.co/EagsGN9gem by @RobertMackey  The Intercept (@theintercept) April 20, 2016Protestors chanted and held signs reading  Kill Them All.

Some apologists for today s crazy right-wing government even argue that if only the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, would be replaced by a  dove,  then peace could be achieved with the Palestinians. However, the lack of peace and the fascism in Israel today is not rooted in its prime minister; rather, it is rooted in the ideology of Zionism that drives him and most Israelis. Zionists believe in an exclusively Jewish state and they always have. The only difference these days is that under the current right wing government, psychotic Israelis are the official main-stream of society and they burn babies and execute Palestinians without hesitation and they know that the government will protect them.This was all on display in Tel Aviv as thousands of Israelis came out in solidarity for the Israeli soldier who executed a Palestinian lying incapacitated on the ground a month ago. The soldier, Elor Azarya, who was filmed shooting the Palestinian last month in the occupied Palestinian town Al-Khalil (Hebron), is facing manslaughter charges. However, Israelis who injure or murder Palestinians rarely face consequences.Watch video of soldier executing Palestinian here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4]Thousands of Israelis rally in support of soldier who executed wounded Palestinian https://t.co/EagsGN9gem by @RobertMackey  The Intercept (@theintercept) April 20, 2016Protestors chanted and held signs reading  Kill Them All.

Some apologists for today s crazy right-wing government even argue that if only the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, would be replaced by a  dove,  then peace could be achieved with the Palestinians. However, the lack of peace and the fascism in Israel today is not rooted in its prime minister; rather, it is rooted in the ideology of Zionism that drives him and most Israelis. Zionists believe in an exclusively Jewish state and they always have. The only difference these days is that under the current right wing government, psychotic Israelis are the official main-stream of society and they burn babies and execute Palestinians without hesitation and they know that the government will protect them.This was all on display in Tel Aviv as thousands of Israelis came out in solidarity for the Israeli soldier who executed a Palestinian lying incapacitated on the ground a month ago. The soldier, Elor Azarya, who was filmed shooting the Palestinian last month in the occupied Palestinian town Al-Khalil (Hebron), is facing manslaughter charges. However, Israelis who injure or murder Palestinians rarely face consequences.Watch video of soldier executing Palestinian here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4]Thousands of Israelis rally in support of soldier who executed wounded Palestinian https://t.co/EagsGN9gem by @RobertMackey  The Intercept (@theintercept) April 20, 2016Protestors chanted and held signs reading  Kill Them All.
